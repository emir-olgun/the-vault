## Progress this month

We have started to investigate popular DAOs on other chains this month about their onboarding and infrastructures.

### Module 1: Oceanfaring Technology
We planned to how to document bridges and side chains. We will have more information about these next month.

### Module 2: Technology of the Ocean
We have started to investigate the tools, DAOs on other blockchains use and how they set up their infrastructures last month.
The DAOs we investigate are:
- Index Coop
- Uniswap
- Bankless
- Aave
- Compound
- Decentraland
- MakerDAO
- Illuvium
- Lido
- Balancer

We have done research on 7 of these DAOs. The status of our research can be seen [**here**](https://tools.littlefish.foundation/littlefish-research/blockchain-ecosystem#large-dao-research-on-different-blockchains)
The documents are:
- [Uniswap](https://tools.littlefish.foundation/littlefish-research/all-docs/other-chains/uniswap-dao)
- [Bankless](https://tools.littlefish.foundation/littlefish-research/all-docs/other-chains/bankless-dao)
- [Aave](https://tools.littlefish.foundation/littlefish-research/all-docs/other-chains/aave-dao)
- [Compound](https://tools.littlefish.foundation/littlefish-research/all-docs/other-chains/compound-dao)
- [Decentraland](https://tools.littlefish.foundation/littlefish-research/all-docs/other-chains/decentraland-dao)
- [MakerDAO](https://tools.littlefish.foundation/littlefish-research/all-docs/other-chains/makerdao)
- [Lido](https://tools.littlefish.foundation/littlefish-research/all-docs/other-chains/lido-dao)
This research is increasing the resources we have.


#### DAO Tools of the Ocean
We have done Milkomeda deep dive and a Blockchain Bridges research document this month.

- [Blockchain Bridges](https://tools.littlefish.foundation/littlefish-research/all-docs/other-chains/blockchain-bridges)

## Discussion

 We plan to generate new deep dives of interesting tools we find in our investigation of other chain DAOs and the tools they use.
