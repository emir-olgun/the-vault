DAOs are the new and prominent actors of digitalized corporations. With their unique and revolutionary features such as being decentralized and autonomous, they promise outstanding solutions to challenges faced due to the distances between people and unnecessary bureaucratic procedures. The way they function prevents the tyrannical system of classic corporations and partnerships. With the emergence of DAOs, a new, more democratic, and decentralized version of corporations and partnerships come to life.

Despite all its perks, DAOs currently face a new challenge in the field of Law. The everlasting need for foreseeability and therefore legal norms raises the question of how to legally categorize and give Decentralized Autonomous Organizations a legal entity. Even though there is no uniform approach to the topic, there are some applicable legislations in different jurisdictions. Namely, in Vermont and Wyoming, new and specific legislations are issued for the DAOs, integrating them mostly into the provisions of LLCs. On the other hand, countries such as Türkiye and Switzerland adopt a different approach. In Türkiye and Switzerland, current legal norms are found to apply to the DAOs. For example, according to Turkish Law, it is possible to regulate DAOs as an ordinary partnerships.

There are various questions and concerns that shall be addressed by the members of a DAO before deciding to establish a legal entity for a DAO. These questions and concerns range from legal relations a DAO aims to conclude, to the liability of the members of a DAO depending on the number of debts and obligations a DAO plans to undertake. One of the most crucial things to keep in mind is the fact that as the debts and obligations a DAO plans to undertake increase, the risk and amount of liability of the members of a DAO increase to the point that the personal properties and financial assets of a member of a DAO may be subjected to a liquidation.

With a legal entity, DAOs will be able to be a part of legal transactions, own property, and assets, sue and be sued, and employ and conduct business with legal entities. The liability of the founders and the participants, the rights and obligations of the DAOs will be clearer and more foreseeable.

**What is a DAO?**

DAO stands for decentralized autonomous organization and they are generally based on smart contracts written on the blockchain. These smart contracts are made according to DAO’s purpose, functioning, distribution, and structure. Their main objective is to bring people together throughout the world to pursue one common mission.

Even though it is challenging to strictly define and identify the main features of each unique DAO, it is safe to say that most DAOs are built on three principles: being decentralized, autonomous, and organizational.

Since it is governed by codes and the governance is mostly distributed amongst its members, DAOs are deemed decentralized. Unlike classic corporations and companies, DAOs lack a governing body and its governance is automated thanks to their underlying blockchain technology and smart contracts.

Additionally, because they can function with the codes without human intervention, DAOs are said to be autonomous. The governing principles and functions of the DAOs are generally imprinted on smart contracts. After its establishment, a DAO can operate and function without needing the approval or initiation of its founders.

Last but not least, DAOs are a type of organization which is gathering people across the world. Its ability to unite people across the globe in something that people want to work on together is simply fascinating. That’s why in our opinion DAOs are not just an organization that is built on smart contracts but rather exceptional and innovative international organization that extinguishes the distance between people.

**Advantages of DAOs**

First of all, due to their digital and technological nature, DAOs generally cut across the limitations set by geographical difficulties. Individuals who decide to become a part of a DAO know the procedures and consequences of each action. The rules and principles of DAOs are predefined, transparent, verifiable, and distributed. Since the governing principles and rules of a DAO are predefined and mostly transparent, members of a DAO generally don’t have to fear uncertainty.

Embezzlement, fraud, and corrupt managers and founders are ever-lasting problems when it comes to trusting classic corporations and organizations. Thanks to the underlying technology of DAOs, namely blockchain, the transactions and accounting of DAOs are generally recorded in its blockchain which enables the members of a DAO to audit and follow the transactions of the DAO.

The very nature of DAOs is compatible with crowdfunding. People with ideas generally lack the necessary capital to realize their projects. With DAOs, even individuals with relatively small capital are incentivized to invest in these projects.

Also, the decision-making procedure of DAOs is a great advantage. If you think about classic corporations, you can see that control of the company is generally left to the central parties. On the other hand, DAOs enable and incentivize their members to be a part of the governance of the DAO.

**Disadvantages of DAOs**

Decision-making is not a free process. It takes time and effort to learn about all of the options and weigh the benefits and drawbacks of each. Since it is inefficient, this is why businesses centralize decision-making by hiring managers who have extensive experience. Decentralized owners or group members are less likely to be informed and understand the consequences of their decisions than a CEO and expert team.

Many corporate decisions are meant to be kept private and unknown to current or prospective competitors or even to its shareholders. This advantage allows businesses to stay ahead of the competition by keeping their data and strategic plans hidden. In contrast, a decentralized decision-making process allows information to be widely accessible, making it more difficult to keep the information confidential.

DAOs may be more susceptible to fraud and hacking than traditional organizations. Since their very existence and function are based upon smart contracts and codes, they are more vulnerable to cyber-attacks. Because DAOs are decentralized, no central authority is responsible for their security. If hackers can gain access to the organization’s computer systems, they can steal funds or user data.

**Why Do People Prefer DAOs?**

Throughout the history of humankind, peoples that manage to form an effective, practical, and relatively fair organization thrive and prosper. As corruption and bureaucratic formalities increase, the efficiency of the organization decreases. The legal and economic structure of the classic organization types started to be questioned long ago. Current legal structures for organizations such as partnerships and companies are wholly regulated. The rights and obligations of said organizations are strictly set forth by the governments. From managing the treasury to voting rules and procedures, almost all of the features and functions of an organization are decided in people’s stead. Applicable classic law lacks the appropriate solutions for new technologies.

Current types of organizations lack the necessary features in the age of digitalization. In addition to their strictly regulated nature, the law itself struggles to address the question arising from new technologies. With the foreseeability, safety, and international nature they have to offer, DAOs emerge as a new type of organization.

**Legal Structures for DAOs**

If you think that there is no application form of legal structure to your DAO, you are gravely mistaken. Even if it is not explicitly stated in law, there are various applicable legal structures for DAOs, namely, Partnerships, Unincorporated Associations, Limited Partnerships and Limited Liability Partnerships, and Limited Liability Corporations.

# DAOs as Partnerships

Because of its structure, a DAO can be seen as a partnership in many jurisdictions. If not legally acknowledged in another legal structure, we can say that a DAO is basically a partnership, as long as that organization is formed for profit.

In general terms, a partnership is a relationship established between persons who agree to share the profits and losses of a business that these persons come together to carry out. Therefore, persons who willingly enter into such a relationship are called **_Partners._**

Firstly, if a person or entity acquired or was granted tokens in the DAO, for instance, through an airdrop or as payment for supplying goods or services to the DAO, that person or entity may become a partner. Tokens that enable its holders to have a say in the decision-making process of the DAO or the tokens that entitle its holders to have a share of the profits and losses of the DAO would be eligible to qualify its holders as a member.

If no other applicable legislation is present, then, organizations that aim to profit are generally considered partnerships. Tokens that grant their holders the power to govern the DAO to some extent, make their holders able to be considered as partners. With being considered as a partner, comes a great amount of power and responsibility. Each partner has the power to bind other partners and partnerships. Each partner is responsible for and entitled to the debts and obligations of the partnership, as well as its profits and rights. That much liability may result in the liquidation of the personal assets of a partner. Finally, the way that partners define themselves in such relations, doesn’t affect the eligibility of a DAO to be considered as a partnership.

# DAO as Unincorporated Association

An unincorporated association is generally an organization that consists of at least two people with whom there is an agreement. The key point of an unincorporated association is the fact that they have to be established to pursue a common goal or fulfill a duty other than making a profit.

If you are seeking a non-profit organization, becoming an unincorporated association may suit you in this journey. Similar to partnerships, if certain conditions are met, members of an unincorporated association may be held liable for the debts and obligations of the unincorporated association. Furthermore, because unincorporated associations lack legal entities, legal affairs may be challenging to be carried out via unincorporated associations.

Also, members of an unincorporated society may be held accountable for the association’s debts in certain circumstances. First, if the rules of the association state that they are liable, such as if they agree to personally indemnify the committee or the trustees for actions taken while transacting business on behalf of the association; and second, members can be liable if they voted in favor of the action that incurred liability.

# Limited Partnerships and Limited Liability Partnerships

Limited partnerships and limited liability partnerships are types of organizations that are recognized by most of governments. Contrary to classic partnerships, at least one of the partners of a limited partnership has limited liability. In limited liability partnerships, liability of all partners is limited.

Because they are meant to address the shortcomings of general partnerships, such as the absence of a legal body and the lack of restricted responsibility for partners, LPs, and LLPs may be appropriate for for-profit DAOs.

Since LLPs and LPs provide a limitation on the liability of its partners, they appear as eligible candidate to address the shortcomings of partnerships. Additionally, the fact that they are a separate legal entity enables them to conduct legal affairs, such as owning property and signing contracts.

# Limited Liability Corporations, LLCs

LLCs are a hybrid of a partnership and a corporation that sprang from partnership law and have become a popular legal form in the United States. While LLCs are not incorporated corporations, they are registered entities that provide their members with limited liability.

Due to its constraints, the LLC is not a great vehicle for DAOs. First, while DAO members are not individually accountable for the LLC’s obligations, they may still be liable for their own torts, such as if a member designed a smart contract poorly.

Second, registering a DAO as an LLC is not final since the registration can be withdrawn. For example, in Delaware, the Attorney General can commence procedures in a court to cancel an LLC’s certificate for misuse or abuse of its limited liability company powers, existence, or advantages. Third, unless the founders of a DAO engage the services of an organization that provides LLCas-a-service, the cost of developing an LLC operating agreement can be considerable since DAOs would be needed to draft their own LLC operating agreement. Finally, while the LLC may work for certain for-profit DAOs, it may not function as well for non-profit DAOs. LLCs provide a substantial amount of limitation on the liability of DAOs’ members. On the other hand, they are subject to a wholly regulated structure which limits the flexibility of DAOs.

# **Worldwide regulations regarding DAOs**

# A. Türkiye

In Turkish Corporate Law, companies are strictly regulated. Only the types of organizations that are foreseen and regulated under Turkish Law can be established in Türkiye. The establishment, governance, rights, and obligation of its partners and shareholders are decided by the law. Due to the lack of legislation, DAOs are not seen as a different type of company under Turkish Law. However, this does not mean that there are no applicable regulations for DAOs.

In Turkish Law, there is a type of organization called ordinary partnership which is also known as an unlimited company or unincorporated association. According to the Turkish Code of Obligations article 620/2: _If a partnership does not have the distinctive features of partnerships regulated by law, it is considered as an ordinary partnership subject to the provisions of this section.”_ Since the DAOs are not legally foreseen by the law, the only applicable piece of legislation regarding them in the manner of corporate law is the provisions that are set forth for the ordinary partnerships. Since DAOs can’t be regarded as regulated partnerships or corporations, rules and principles regarding ordinary partnerships will be applied to DAOs.

For ordinary partnerships, there is no written form requirement. Even the actions of people can be regarded as the formation of an ordinary partnership. The lack of written form requirement increases the possibility of DAOs being accepted as ordinary partnerships.

In ordinary partnerships, there is no limitation on the number of partners possible. Since DAOs tend to have many members, ordinary partnerships are flexible and applicable in this manner. Also, partners of ordinary partnerships are obligated to provide capital which can be anything that has an economic value. In the context of DAOs, tokens or assets that give out partnership rights have the strong possibility to result in the acceptance of holders as a partner.

# B. Wyoming

In July 2021, Wyoming passed a law allowing the establishment of DAOs for the first time in the world and became the first state to recognize DAOs as limited liability corporations (LLCs) within the United States. Thus, in Wyoming, DAOs gained legal status as limited liability companies and were recognized by state authorities. Therefore, relevant rules and principles regarding LLCs will apply to DAOs that are established as LLCs. Such as articles of Association, members’ rights, duties, relationships, voting rights, DAO activities and how they are carried out, ways to change articles or articles of association, distributions to members, transferability of membership interests, member contributions, liquidation, and distributions to members after termination, changing, updating smart contracts or regulatory procedures.

More importantly, DAOs that are established as LLCs have a legal personality and therefore can own assets and be entitled to have legal affairs with one another on their own. Apart from that, according to Wyo. Stat Ann article 17–31–109, DAOs can be “algorithmically managed” by the underlying smart contract without human intervention. The DAO is not required to disclose the operation of the smart contract or contracts used to run the DAO’s business, but the law requires that the underlying smart contracts be “amended or otherwise editable”. This requirement can pose a challenge for many DAOs because one of the main advantages of using blockchain and smart contracts is that the record is immutable.

# C. Vermont

The Vermont Limited Company Act provides that DAOs can be registered as Blockchain Based LLCs (BBLLC). A BBLLC is a DAO that has been incorporated in Vermont as a Limited Liability Company (LLC). **_This act allows a DAO to enter into legally binding contracts and protects its owners, managers, and blockchain participants from unwarranted liability. As a result, general LLC provisions apply to BBLLCs._** The key development in this act is that company governance can be provided entirely or in part through blockchain technology. The act also recognizes the use of blockchain-based smart contracts for voting on BBLLC operations and activities.

# D. Tennessee

Tennessee followed Wyoming’s lead and enacted its own DAO law. The entity type in Tennessee’s legislation, on the other hand, is referred to as a “decentralized organization,” or “DO.” **_DO LLCs are subject to Tennessee’s ordinary LLC legislation as well. In many ways, Tennessee law is extremely similar to Wyoming law._**

# E. Marshall Islands

In February 2022, the Marshall Islands officially recognized DAOs. As a result of amendments to the non-Profit Entities Act, which came into force in 2021, DAOs can be established as non-profit limited companies and memberships can be registered on the blockchain. The first legal DAO on the island was registered as Admiralty LLC of Shipyard Software, a DeFi-focused infrastructure developer.

# F. Australia

Currently, DAOs do not have legal personalities in Australia. At Australian Blockchain Week on March 21, 2022, Senator Andrew Bragg spoke of the legislator’s intention to draft regulation regarding DAOs. This regulation is expected to exclude algorithmic DAOs and is considered to be applied retroactively after a transition period. For now, a DAO can only benefit from the relevant regulations by becoming a legal entity that would be recognized in Australia.

# G. Switzerland

There is no specific legislation for DAOs in Switzerland at this time. Because there is no specific legislation adjusted to these new types of entities, we must rely on the existing laws to understand them in the legal order. DAOs as organizations should be acknowledged and qualified under private international law in order for their legal effects to be defined in Switzerland. The Swiss Private International Law Act (PILA) thus governs the recognition of foreign DAOs in Switzerland. The concern of a DAO being recognized as a validly formed company is the foundation of its presence as a subject of obligations and rights without which a DAO cannot perform legal acts or institute legal proceedings. According to Maltese and Vermont legislation, regulated DAOs are adequately structured under Art. 150 PILA to qualify as companies under private international law. As a result, **_if a regulated DAO is validly formed under the law under which it is organized, it can be recognized in the Swiss law order under Art. 154 par. 1 PILA._**

**Should a DAO Seek a Legal Entity?**

In terms of liability, becoming a legal entity may not be favorable for some members of a DAO. It depends on the choice of the legal structure and the favorable options of a such legal structure shall be considered in the meantime. Please see our questions below and make an assessment of whether you would prefer to become a legal entity. Also, there is a table below which shows the possible phases of a DAO. You may compare your DAO’s situation and decide whether you should establish a legal entity or not.

here are some fundamental questions that members of a DAO should ask themselves:

-   As a DAO, do you wish to enter into legal relations with other natural persons or legal entities?
-   Do you want your DAO or yourselves as the side of possible legal relations?
-   As a member of a DAO do you want to create a separate legal entity for your DAO that enables its members to have limited liability or do you want to risk the possibility of being considered as a partnership and therefore personally liable for the debts and obligations of the DAO?
-   Do you want your DAO to own property, to have a bank account?
-   Do you want your DAO to be eligible to pursue its rights before courts and other relevant legal and administrative authorities?
-   Depending on the actions your DAO takes and the debts and obligations that it undertakes, is the risk of being personally liable for the debts and obligations of your DAO affordable and foreseeable?
-   Are you ready to afford, undertake and provide the legal and administrative infrastructure to conclude the bureaucratic, monetary, and legal procedures of establishing a legal entity? Considering your actions, revenues, and profits, is establishing a legal entity for your DAO affordable and worth it?
-   In what jurisdiction do you wish to establish a legal entity for your DAO? Are you qualified to establish one according to that jurisdiction? Do you have the legal infrastructure and resources needed for such an action?
-   To what extent do the legal obligations, procedures, and liabilities comply with the way your DAO wishes to operate?
-   Does your DAO plan to develop and air an application of any kind? If yes, are you planning to do it via major intermediaries such as Google Store, Apple Store, or any kind of intermediary that functions as a marketplace for apps?

In the case of saying yes or giving relevant answers in favor of establishing a legal entity to the questions above, then, it is probably time to think of seeking a legal entity for your DAO.

![[legal-img-1.png]]

**_First of all, explanations regarding this table shall be examined with utmost care. Every DAO has unique features, therefore, please do contact your legal advisor._**

**_Even though we strongly urge DAOs to have legal entities, if your DAO falls into the scope of Level 0–2 and doesn’t own a considerable amount of assets, then, your DAO probably will be fine without having a legal entity. As a DAO progresses and evolves, the liability of its members increases. After becoming a Level 3 DAO, the obligations and debts a DAO tends to undertake vastly increase. To avoid unexpected personal liability, establishing a separate legal entity for the DAO is strongly recommended._**

**Risks of Having and Not Having Legal Entity**

As mentioned above, liability for members is a risk. One may want to put forward the entity instead of its members when it comes to being liable for DAOs’ actions. If an entity is not legally acknowledged, as a rule, it cannot be a party to a contract or own property. If a DAO wishes to participate in such businesses, it is best to seek a legal entity.

In the case of a DAO not having any legal entity, it may easily result in holding the founders or even the participants of the DAO solely and personally responsible. With the legal entity, this liability shifts from real persons to the entity itself, and the real persons who participate in the entity are generally liable for the damages up to the amount that they committed. To clarify, if the DAO fails to fulfill the debts and obligations it undertook, then, the partners are responsible to indemnify these debts and obligations. In this context, even a partner's personal and financial assets may be subject to liquidation.

Furthermore, rights and obligations are generally entitled to those with legal personality. An organization that lacks a legal entity cannot pursue its rights and obligations via courts, or it cannot be part of legal relations. Moreover, it is not possible for an organization without a legal entity to be an owner of something.

To sum it all up, depending on how and under which name it gains legal entity, having a legal entity can be beneficial for the participants of a DAO for liability issues. With the legal entity established, the liability of the debts and other not preferable obligations shifts to the legal entity to some extent. Also, since the DAO with no legal entities cannot sue or be sued, the risk of not effectively pursuing or defending the rights of the DAO may emerge.

**How to Create a Legal Entity for a DAO?**

The challenges of creating a legal entity for a DAO may vary depending on where you reside. There are two main pieces of legislation outlined in the U.S.A, namely Wyoming and Vermont. For example, in order to create a legal entity for the DAO in Wyoming, the DAO must be registered. In addition to the many other documents, statements and information for classic LLCs, information regarding the governance of the DAO via smart contract and a statement establishing how the DAO shall be managed by the members, including to what extent the management will be conducted algorithmically, must be issued. Also, to register a DAO in Wyoming, one must also have a Wyoming registered agent who meets the statutory requirements.

In conclusion, if you decide to create a legal personality for your DAO, you may establish your DAO as an LLC in Wyoming or Vermont. The requirements to establish a classic LLC in Wyoming and Vermont is the same for the establishment of a DAO as an LLC. Any person, even if they are not U.S. citizens, may establish a DAO LLC and start a business in the U.S.A.
