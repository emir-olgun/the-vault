## Progress this month

We have focused on the project with our entire team this month and finished all the milestones left of this project. We have generated 15 original documents this month and around 75 new resources. With these new documents and resources, We have 31 documents in total and around 279 curated resources.

### Module 1: Oceanfaring Technology

We have generated 9 new documents this month. Some of them are tool deep dives and some of them are documents explaining technological concepts and reports.
Here are the documents we generated:
- [Cardano Cross-Chain Report](https://tools.littlefish.foundation/littlefish-research-hub/blockchain-ecosystem/cardano-cross-chain-report)
- [Atomic Swaps and Atomic Swap on Cardano](https://tools.littlefish.foundation/littlefish-research-hub/all-docs/other-chains/what-is-cross-chain/atomic-swaps-and-atomic-swap-on-cardano)
- [Blockchain Oracles](https://tools.littlefish.foundation/littlefish-research-hub/all-docs/other-chains/what-is-cross-chain/blockchain-oracles)
- [Sidechains](https://tools.littlefish.foundation/littlefish-research-hub/all-docs/other-chains/what-is-cross-chain/sidechains)
- [Milkomeda](https://tools.littlefish.foundation/littlefish-research-hub/all-docs/other-chains/what-is-cross-chain/blockchain-bridges/milkomeda)
- [Wanchain](https://tools.littlefish.foundation/littlefish-research-hub/all-docs/other-chains/what-is-cross-chain/blockchain-bridges/wanchain)
- [Celer and NuFi Bridges](https://tools.littlefish.foundation/littlefish-research-hub/all-docs/other-chains/what-is-cross-chain/blockchain-bridges/celer-and-nufi-bridges)

- [Orcfax and Chainlink Oracles](https://tools.littlefish.foundation/littlefish-research-hub/all-docs/other-chains/what-is-cross-chain/blockchain-oracles/orcfax-and-chainlink-oracles)

### Module 2: Technology of the Ocean
We started to investigate the tools, DAOs on other blockchains use and how they set up their infrastructures 2 months ago.

We have completed our DAO investigation and in total we have 10 DAO investigations. With this research we have found DAO tools used by these DAOs and how they run their DAO operations such as governance. We also generated DAO research document according to the DAO investigation tasks. In total we have generated 5 new documents in this module.

Here are the documents we generated:
- [Tools of the Ocean Report](https://tools.littlefish.foundation/littlefish-research-hub/blockchain-ecosystem/tools-of-the-ocean-report)
- [DAO Research](https://tools.littlefish.foundation/littlefish-research-hub/all-docs/other-chains/dao-research)
- [Illuvium DAO Research](https://tools.littlefish.foundation/littlefish-research-hub/all-docs/other-chains/dao-research/illuvium-dao-research)
- [Balancer DAO Research](https://tools.littlefish.foundation/littlefish-research-hub/all-docs/other-chains/dao-research/balancer-dao-research)
- [1inch DAO Research](https://tools.littlefish.foundation/littlefish-research-hub/all-docs/other-chains/dao-research/1inch-dao)

#### Project Catalyst
We have finished and published Tools of Project Catalyst Report. It can be found here:
