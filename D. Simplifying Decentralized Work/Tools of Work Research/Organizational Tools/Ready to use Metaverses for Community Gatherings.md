[***OVR (over the reality)***](https://www.overthereality.ai/)

AR (augmented reality)
ETH & Polygon
[Whitepaper (link)](https://docs.overthereality.ai/over-whitepaper//)
[IOS App (link)](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/over-over-the-reality/id1463400310/)
[Android (link)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gezapp.ovr&hl=en&gl=US/) 

**Concept overview:**
Over uses augmented reality, a technology capable of adding different types of content to the surrounding environment (video, audio, 2D and 3D), creating the illusion that reality and virtuality live together in the same space. All this is in real-time and from any device with a camera, such as smartphones and smart glasses. This innovation makes it possible to “trace” the elements present in the real world and add other virtual ones. The union between real and digital generates a unique merged experience.

**Features:**
* Avatar to Avatar Voice Chat
* In-app text chat (group chat?)
* Ability to meet and move in realtime
* Ability to meet vitually, take photos together,& record up to 60s at a time
* Video sharing/Conferencing/Town Halls? (Do we need a land to set up?)

[***CARDASTATION:***](https://www.cardastation.com)

VR (virtual reality)
Cardano
[Whitepaper (link)](https://3366648650-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2Fs3Y7SIgzAGo9m12yampc%2Fuploads%2FGpZWCxw5h72jarg5arYx%2FCarda%20Station%20Litepaper%20(4).pdf?alt=media&token=a2a8da4b-5fc9-4f63-adc3-9587d4a5d580)

**Concept overview:**
Carda Station is a Cardano metaverse set on the moon. The vision of Carda Station is to have a blockchain based, lived-in world where residents and visitors can interact with each other and their novel surroundings as a character in the in-engine environment. 

In this moon-based virtual world, you will be able to:
● Own and build on plots of land
● Interact with other players 
● Play a variety of games
● Host and attend events
● Interact with/set up a business

Note:
The app is in pre-alpha stage.
Currently the metaverse is not optimized. So game becomes very heavy and laggy after the first few interactions. Game UX/UI needs more cleaning up.
