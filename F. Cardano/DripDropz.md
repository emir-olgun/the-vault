# DripDropz: Democratizing Token Distribution on the Cardano Ecosystem

A new player has entered the Cardano ecosystem, aiming to revolutionize token distribution for blockchain projects. Introducing DripDropz, an intuitive platform that offers token dispensing services to projects of all sizes within the Cardano community. The platform welcomes delegates to reap the rewards by providing the ability to withdraw a variety of tokens while remaining delegated to a community pool.

## DripDropz Tokenomics and the $DRIP Token

DripDropz has introduced a native utility token, $DRIP, with a maximum supply of 45 billion tokens. These tokens are allocated exclusively for users of the platform, distributed through DripDropz at a flat rate. Each delegate will receive 1,000 $DRIP tokens per epoch, with the possibility of tokens rolling over when the Hydra back payment feature is implemented.

To receive $DRIP tokens, delegates must have a minimum of 10 ADA staked to any stake pool. There is no maximum ADA limit for user wallets. Wallet splitting is allowed and encouraged to a degree, as long as users continue to delegate to community pools.

## How to Withdraw Tokens on DripDropz

To withdraw tokens on DripDropz, users should follow these steps:

1. Visit the DripDropz site and enter your wallet receive/stake address in the search bar.
2. Select up to 10 tokens for withdrawal based on your wallet's ADA amount and delegated pool.
3. Confirm your selection and pay the required fee to complete the withdrawal.

The withdrawal process repeats every epoch, allowing users to maximize their token rewards.

### Cost and Service Fee Breakdown

DripDropz applies a small fee for each withdrawal, which serves as the platform's sole revenue source. The fee structure depends on the number of tokens withdrawn and covers Cardano transaction fees, Phyrhose processing fees, and DripDropz service fees.

## Referral System: Earn $DRIP by Inviting Friends

DripDropz offers a referral system that rewards both the referrer and the referred user with 1,000 $DRIP tokens. To participate in the referral program, users must create an account on DripDropz, which will grant access to the referral page where they can input their referral payout address.

In conclusion, DripDropz presents an innovative approach to token distribution in the Cardano ecosystem, benefiting both blockchain projects and community members. By simplifying the process of token withdrawals and providing incentives for users to engage with the platform, DripDropz is set to make a significant impact on the Cardano landscape.
