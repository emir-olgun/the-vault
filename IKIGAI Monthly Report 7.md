#### Progress report
Over the past few months we've had several discussions of how we wanted to implement an IKIGAI UI. IKIGAI is a visual tool and the most important thing is for it to be a fun experience while doing it. Simply answering a few questions as if filling in a survey didn't sit well with us, so we decided it was the best option to provide a gamified experience in 3d. We don't have any experience with building 3d worlds, but we aren't aiming at something too complicated, and with the advent of AI learning and building this type of tool has become much simpler. 

So this month, we've spent on learning and trying things out with threejs. We've researched many other 3d modeling libraries on JS, but decided to go with threejs as it has a lot of content online, and has the features we want. We're not looking to build a full on game so it's limited gaming functionality suits us. 

Next month we'll have a basic v1 ready to play.
