## Introduction

MintMatrix is an DAO governance tool for helping to create and maintain DAOs. It operates within the Cardano ecosystem and its primary goal is to develop blockchain solutions for the bespoke ecosystem. It is specifically committed to developing a frictionless financial infrastructure for its users. 
A frictionless financial infrastructure refers to a system where financial transactions can be conducted quickly, easily, and without unnecessary barriers or obstacles. It involves using advanced technology to streamline processes and remove inefficiencies that can slow down or complicate financial transactions.

## How Does It Work?

Unfortunately, we are only able to transmit what the website claims it can do and what it aims for. It seems like the website itself is not well maintained. In other words, it does not work at all. 
According to MintMatrix, potentially, a user can easily manage their digital assets because it is specifically built for DAOs to conduct their business and govern their network on the given infrastructure. Apart from that, the claimed services include;
* Token Minting
* DAO creation and management
* Custom smart contracts
* Token identity gateways
* Payment gateways
* High quality paper wallets

##### Why these services are essential?

1. Token minting is the process of creating new tokens for a blockchain network. It is an essential process that enables the issuance of new tokens, allowing blockchain projects to raise funds and distribute tokens to their users. A pre-existing minting mechanism would go along the way nicely for newly emerging DAOs.
2. Creating a DAO can be a complex process, so it's important to have a deep understanding of blockchain technology, governance structures, and decision-making processes.
3. The smart contract is the code that defines the rules and processes for the DAO. This includes defining the governance structure, the decision-making process, the tokenomics, and any other relevant information. Normally, individuals and enterprises need to work with numerous people to realize their projects.
4. With safe token identity and payment gateways users, stakeholders and creators conduct their business more efficiently. Which in return helps the DAO to expand and grow.
5. With high quality paper wallets, digital assests can be stored safely. Providing a safe space for users' assets is the definitive feature for any DAO to operate among general public.


This process, in theory, can easily be started by connecting a wallet to the website, then you are in business.

However, it seems like all lights are out on the page where you actually connect your wallet. In theory, creating a DAO, minting tokens, digital currencies, and any other type of digital assets are one click away thanks to MintMatrix. But unfortunately, all of these promises break down at the first initial step because connecting the wallet page does not work. Which is the initial step for individuals or enterprises to leap into the world of blockchain. Apart from that on default there are four electronic wallet options for users to choose.

Our inquiries about the page and the system itself were not replied to by the creators as well. Also, designated Discord server for MintMatrix does not contain enough information to transmit here.

## Its Place In DAOs and Conclusion

In a world where this system fully functions and is well-maintained, MintMatrix could achieve many great things. Participation and usage of blockchain could be increased immensely. Because such an infrastructure would ease up entry and remove barriers. However, at the moment, it does not deliver what it claims. There is a possibility that why MintMatrix does not spark any interest or does not deliver any tangibles may relate to the fact that the system is still in its pre-Alpha phase but from the looks of it, it is highly unlikely because there is no progress log or response from the creators. 
Our attempts to reach out to the whitepaper or the creator himself were also unfruitful. As a part of the blockchain world and admirers of DAOs, the premise of a safe and easy medium for DAO creation and maintenance was quite exciting for us but unfortunately, I have to report that MintMatrix does not live up to its promises. 
Finally, it is beneficial to mention that, the very idea itself is very impressive. Because we all want the blockchain environment to expand and become mainstream and after all we need such a system to realize this wish. Hopefully, the creators will put more weight into this idea and make MintMatrix a truly functioning tool that would potentially benefit lots of people.
