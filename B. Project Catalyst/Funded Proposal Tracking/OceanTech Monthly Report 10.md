## Progress this month

We had to focus on other tasks this month and could not gain any progress on this proposal this month.

### Module 1: Oceanfaring Technology

We plan to have more information on Bridges and Side-Chains documents next month.

### Module 2: Technology of the Ocean
We started to investigate the tools, DAOs on other blockchains use and how they set up their infrastructures 2 months ago.

The DAOs we investigate are:
- Index Coop
- Uniswap
- Bankless
- Aave
- Compound
- Decentraland
- MakerDAO
- Illuvium
- Lido
- Balancer

Since we had to focus on other tasks, we could not do any updates on this module. We plan to have more updates next month.


#### DAO Tools of the Ocean
We do not have any updates on these this month. We plan to have more docs next month.


## Discussion

 We plan to generate new deep dives of interesting tools we find in our investigation of other chain DAOs and the tools they use.
