## Progress this month

### Module 1: Legal Research
Read about this module here: [[NewOrder - Modules#**Module 1: Legal Research**]]

The legal team has finished work on **1 - Legal status of LFF Action NFTs**. The status is under review. We've provided feedback to the team about the work, and they are now integrating it into their research. We will then publish it on our now gitbook based knowledge base, along with a shorter Medium article version, and an even shorter tweetstorm to follow.

Here's the work: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oJflHnYkVsSCMnFtKs-Yb5m6IzpXfDog/edit

We've also provided the legal team with the research specification for the next topic: 4 - Legal frameworks for tokens and coins. You can find it [here](https://littlefishdao.notion.site/Research-Specification-Legal-framework-for-tokens-and-coins-7b301431bd3941eeb854e5eab6c64766).
