![[DAOWork - Modules#**Module 1: Wallets**#Key Milestones and expected deliveries#]]

#### Progress report

Wallet docs revisions were done last month. Only GameChanger wallet document was not updated because it was down due to a technical issue. It will be revised when it is running again.

### Module 2: Digital Work Tools
![[DAOWork - Modules#**Module 2: Digital Work Tools**#Key Milestones and expected deliveries#]]

#### Progress report

Digital Work tools were completed last month. We decided to make a comprehensive road-map that combines Map of decentralized work tools and the DAO tools map. This task can be seen below.


### Module 3: Cardano DAO Tools
![[DAOWork - Modules#**Module 3: DAO Tools**#Key Milestones and expected deliveries:]]

#### Progress report

The some of the DAO tool deep dives we wrote were not actually DAO tools. We researched more DAO tools this month. Finding DAO tools were quite difficult as there are not many organizations working on DAO tools on Cardano blockchain yet. We managed to generate six DAO tools this month. 

 - [[Crystal]]: This is a platform for DAO governance.
 - [[Paideia]]: This is a DAO governing platform running on Ergo and coming to Cardano.
 - [[TosiDrop]]: This is a token distribution platform for DAOs.
 - [[MintMatrix]]: This is a platform for voting and minting. We could not access the tool due to a bug and could not contact the team.
 - [[Voteaire]]: A voting platform for DAOs.
 - [[DripDropz]]: A token distribution platform for DAOs.
 
With the new documents, we have 11 DAO tool deep dives in total.

We are also working on a roadmap that includes DAO tools, tools of work and wallets. We are inspired by a website called [roadmap](https://roadmap.sh) and we are building a roadmap that includes DAO tools, tools of work, wallets, and cross-chain tools in this map.

On this roadmap, we are mapping the steps from an idea to functional working DAO and required tools for the DAO in every step.

We have a proof of concept that we are working to test on our platform. This PoC only includes the first phase of the map and here is the proof of concept.

## Discussion

Finding new DAO tools were a difficult task as there are not many organizations working on such projects.
