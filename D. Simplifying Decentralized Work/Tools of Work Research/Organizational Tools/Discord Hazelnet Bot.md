Normally, no one, including administrators, can see the addresses that are integrated using Hazelnet bot. It has been designed in this way for user privacy.
  
If managers need to reach addresses for some purposes, a whitelist must be created to obtain the address codes of the users. The addresses of the users who join the white list voluntarily will be visible to the dev team with the REST API.
