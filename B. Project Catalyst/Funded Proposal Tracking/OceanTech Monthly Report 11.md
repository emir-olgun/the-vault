## Progress this month

Since the our other project of Tools of DAO Work took longer than expected we could not finish the Ocean Tech project this month.
We have planned the next months plan. We will complete the reports, docs, and curated resources this month.
We currently have 22 docs and 200 curated resources. We plan to increase these numbers to 27 docs and more than 250 curated resources next month.


### Module 1: Oceanfaring Technology

We have been working on docs on Wanchain and Charli3, and improving our Milkomeda doc but they are not complete as of this date.

### Module 2: Technology of the Ocean
We started to investigate the tools, DAOs on other blockchains use and how they set up their infrastructures 2 months ago.

The DAOs we investigate are:
- Index Coop
- Uniswap
- Bankless
- Aave
- Compound
- Decentraland
- MakerDAO
- Illuvium
- Lido
- Balancer

Since we had to focus on other tasks, we could not do any updates on this module. We have started to work on the remaining DAO investigations and we will finish this task in couple of days.

#### DAO Tools of the Ocean
We do not have any updates on these this month. We plan to have more docs next month.

## Discussion

We plan to generate new docs, resources and reports next month in order to finish the project.
