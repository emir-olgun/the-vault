## Progress this month

We have started to investigate popular DAOs on other chains this month about their onboarding and infrastructures.

### Module 1: Oceanfaring Technology
We planned to how to document bridges and side chains. We will have more information about these next month.

### Module 2: Technology of the Ocean
We have started to investigate the tools, DAOs on other blockchains use and how they set up their infrastructures.
The DAOs we investigate are:
- Index Coop
- Uniswap
- Bankless
- Aave
- Compound
- Decentraland
- MakerDAO
- Illuvium
- Lido
- Balancer
Our community is learning about the tools these DAOs use and finding resources about these tools.


#### DAO Tools of the Ocean
We are working on Milkomeda deep dive, we plan to publish it soon.

## Discussion

 We plan to generate new deep dives of interesting tools we find in our investigation of other chain DAOs and the tools they use.
