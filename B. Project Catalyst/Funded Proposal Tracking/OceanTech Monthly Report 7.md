## Progress this month

We have moved our documents from Obsidian to Gitbook and done a DAO tools research into other chains especially Ethereum and found the missing pieces on Cardano ecosystem.

### Module 1: Oceanfaring Technology
The quality of work is significantly increased after we created quality and document standards.

### Module 2: Technology of the Ocean
We have moved all our documents from Obsidian to Gitbook this month. We also sped up our research into other blockchains and the tools they use. 


#### DAO Tools of the Ocean
We have done a research on DAO tools on other chains. [here](https://littlefish-1.gitbook.io/dao-work/ocean-tech/ocean-research) is the document that includes the links of these tools.
We also categorized the tools we found as best as we could. [here](https://littlefish-1.gitbook.io/dao-work/ocean-tech/ocean-research/dao-tools-on-other-chains) the document can be seen.
These works are still in progress, the documents will have much more information next month.

## Discussion

The migration from Obsidian to Gitbook took some time. The research into other blockchains will be much more comprehensive this month.
