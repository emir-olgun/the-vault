## 8. Notes from the Author
The Fireflies app adds a lot of value to teams, individuals, and organizations by automating insight findings, action items, and self-evaluations from meetings. 

Although it does come with a couple of downsides. Most features are behind a paywall subscription. This gives very little room for users to test the app and understand the vast benefits it provides.
Security is another concern of mine even if the team behind Flireflies.ai claims to take it very seriously. I do feel uncomfortable when personal/organizational data is handled in a black box and the data creators/owners have very little control over it.

All in all, I highly suggest that readers try out Fireflies.ai while being conscious of sensitive data.
