## Additional Notes

As of March 2023, GameChanger Wallet is not functional because Dandelion API, which is used by GameChanger, is down. There is currently no information about the fix yet.

GameChanger community is active and planning to migrate to GameChanger V2.

These are the important warnings made by developers of GameChanger Wallet.
